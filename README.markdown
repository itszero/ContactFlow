ContactFlow
===========

Simple app brings you CoverFlow for your Mac Address Book. This is actually a conceptual implementation dated back to 2007, when the CoverFlow private API first discovered. I just wanna play with the CoverFlow API, so this is how this app being made. :D

I'm now releasing it because a friend just asks me about "Is there any app can do this?". I suddenly remembered I have done this before, and there is no app in my knowledge do this, so I'm releasing it out. :P

Features
--------

 - Open it, and you get ContactFlow. :D
 - A search bar which can filter through name, company field.
 - Double-click on the avatar, and Address Book pops out with his/her entry opened for you.

Compatibility
-------------
This app is tested to be compiled on 10.5 / 10.6, 32-bit/64-bit universal binary, so I guess it would work on most of your computers.
